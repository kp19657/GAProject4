## Programming Languages

The stack used in this project is the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js stack.

## Known Limitations of The App

The user is not able to run a search query yet. This feature will be added in a future version of the app. Also, the images files are currently hosted on the local drive of the server. In the future, these files can be hosted on an Amazon S3 cloud server instead for faster and more reliable loading.
